# Why a roadmap?
I like to consider my personal website as a product that I will continuously iterate on and build on top of. So, to keep track of new ideas (or features) and organize them properly, I use this simple productivity tool called <a href="https://trello.com/en" target="_blank">Trello</a> to add new cards for each feature and move them accross different stages of my (oversimplified) Agile Software Development process for this particular product.

## Fun fact ðŸ’¡
If you're curious, I'm embedding this Trello Board using an `iframe`, like this:

```html
<iframe 
    src="trello-board-url.html" 
    frameBorder="0" 
    width="100%" 
    height="600">
</iframe>
```
