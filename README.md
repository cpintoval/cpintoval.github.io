# Personal Website - cpintoval.github.io
## Overview
Code that powers my personal website, which you can visit by going to [cpintoval.github.io](https://cpintoval.github.io/).

This website is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator built on [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), and it's hosted right here using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

As the base style, I'm using a customized version of the [Clean Blog Jekyll Theme](https://github.com/StartBootstrap/startbootstrap-clean-blog-jekyll) built by StartBootstrap (check them out!).

## Installation and Setup
I use this as a my own instruction manual, but feel free to use it as well.

1. Make sure all Jekyll and Bundler are installed in your local machine. Follow [these instructions](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) in case you don't have them installed yet.
2. [Download](https://github.com/cpintoval/cpintoval.github.io/archive/main.zip) or clone this repository.
3. Run `bundle install` to install all dependencies.
4. Build the site by running `bundle exec jekyll serve`. This command will start your local server on [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000/) by default, but you can change parameters like the Port by adding arguments to this command. Run `jekyll serve --help` for more information.
5. Make, add, commit, and push your changes!

## Syntax Highlighting
This site uses Kramdown Rouge as the syntax highlighter. I'm using a custom version of the base16.solarized theme.

- For more information on installation and theme changes, here's a [quick tutorial](https://bnhr.xyz/2017/03/25/add-syntax-highlighting-to-your-jekyll-site-with-rouge.html).
- To test other Rouge themes, here's a [neat website](https://spsarolkar.github.io/rouge-theme-preview/) to test them out.
